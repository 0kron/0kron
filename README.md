### About Me
I am above all things, self-taught, and driven by curiosity and challenge. While searching for responsibilities or jobs I do not focus on how much money I can make, but rather on ways to keep advancing in my career and extending my horizons. Every person and every piece of knowledge is a knot in a web, my role is to use what others teach me, what intrigues me and what motivates me to improve both who I am and where I am.
